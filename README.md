# HeteroDiT

HeteroDiT is a heterogeneous on-device DiT inference framework with pure C++ backend. It aims at providing efficient NPU, GPU, and CPU acceleration for local picture/video generation. Future develop plans include dynamic heterogeneous scheduling and entensive LLM model/hardware support. 

## Features

- Plain C/C++ implementation based on [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), working in the same way as [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [stable_diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp)
